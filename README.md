# Python POC Stuff

This is a collection of samples, ideas, proof of concept etc.

It may not make sense to most people, but I share me experiments none the less - perhaps some body else can also benefit from my trial and error.

The code is 'Public Domain'.

## Repository Content

* [selective_class_loading/poc001](https://github.com/nicc777/python_poc_stuff/tree/master/code/selective_class_loading/poc001) - Dynamically load classes that implement a certain base class. Expose those loaded classes in a dictionary.
* [config_loading/poc001](https://github.com/nicc777/python_poc_stuff/tree/master/code/config_loading/poc001) - Load Python source file as config dynamically. 

## The Fine Print

Please take note of the following:

* Some code examples were copied (or adapted) from other sources on the Internet, especially from [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). I assume all code and examples from public Internet sites are considered public domain (or Open Source) and where possible, if I have the original link, I will add it. If you find some of your code examples on my site without a link back, and you would like to add it, please drop me a note – I will gladly add it.
* I do not consider this code “production ready” – the examples are intended to illustrate or explore a possible solution to a given problem – it may not be the best. It may not be “secure”. Use at your own risk! If you have alternative suggestions, please share your views.
* Comments are moderated. It’s mostly to keep out spammers. I will also not tolerate racism, personal attacks or any of that stuff in comments. If you disagree with something in a post or comment, make your argument and don’t make it personal or weird.
* My code published here I consider “public domain”. Sometimes I will link to repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/). Please note that projects hosted at GitHub or other such repositories may carry various licenses. If you feel I somehow violated your license terms, please drop me note. I have no problem to accommodate requests as long as they are within reason.
